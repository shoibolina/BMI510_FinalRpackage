\title{Title: Approximate data based on principal components}
\usage{
pcApprox(x, npc)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector or matrix.}

\item{npc}{Number of principal components to use.}
}
\value{
The approximation of the data based on the specified number of principal components.
}
\description{
Returns an approximation to the data based on a specified number of principal components.
The approximation is rescaled and centered to match the original data.
}
\examples{
# Example 1: Approximating a matrix with 3 principal components
set.seed(123)
data_matrix <- matrix(rnorm(100), nrow = 10)
approx_matrix <- pcApprox(data_matrix, npc = 3)
